# Bitasmbl-Real-Time-Stock-Heatmap-Dashboard-23eed5

## Description
Build an interactive dashboard that visualizes live stock market performance using a color-coded heatmap. Users can filter sectors, view market movements, and monitor real-time changes as data updates dynamically.

## Tech Stack
- Objective-C
- GraphQL
- SignalR

## Requirements
- Handle API rate limits, errors, or missing data gracefully
- Display trend changes with smooth, real-time UI updates
- Allow users to filter stocks by category, sector, or custom criteria
- Render an interactive heatmap representing stock performance
- Fetch real-time and periodically updated stock market data

## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester/Bitasmbl-Real-Time-Stock-Heatmap-Dashboard-23eed5.git
- Install Objective-C dependencies as configured in the project

## Usage
- Build and run the Objective-C application
- Configure GraphQL and SignalR endpoints in the app settings

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Objective-C project structure for the dashboard UI
2. Define GraphQL queries for real-time and periodic stock data
3. Integrate SignalR client to receive live stock updates
4. Implement heatmap rendering for stock performance visualization
5. Add filtering logic for category, sector, and custom criteria
6. Implement smooth UI updates on incoming data changes
7. Add error and rate-limit handling with graceful fallbacks
8. Validate handling of missing or partial stock data
